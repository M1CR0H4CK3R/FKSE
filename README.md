# FKSE
FKSE - A Save Editor for the Nintendo GameCube game Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom written in C#.

Planned features:

Money editing

Items editing

Monster stats editing

Character stats editing

Checksum recalculation

Some code was taken from <a href="https://github.com/Cuyler36/ACSE">ACSE</a> by <a href="https://github.com/Cuyler36">Cuyler36</a> and
adapted to Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom.

This is a work in progress, but since I got one of the files rewritten already, and got permission from <a href="https://github.com/Cuyler36">Cuyler36</a>, I decided
to publish what I have so far.

This is my first ever real attempt at coding an application in ANY programming language whatsoever, so if anyone wants to
help by notifying me of any mistakes I may make, it would be appreciated. I also plan to document the save file structure and
checksum algorithm in the Wiki section really soon, and if anyone wants to implement the checksum calculation for me, that
would also be appreciated.
