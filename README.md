Some code was initially taken from <a href="https://github.com/Cuyler36/ACSE">ACSE</a> by <a href="https://github.com/Cuyler36">Cuyler36</a> and adapted to Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom. Since then, <a href="https://github.com/Cuyler36">Cuyler36</a> has been working on the coding aspect, while I have done all of the documentation on the save file. As things are now, a release should come really shortly, but if you want to build it yourself, you'll need Visual Studio Community 2017, then building should be self-explanatory after that.

Although we couldn't have made it this far without each other, I think that credit for the editor should go first and foremost to <a href="https://github.com/Cuyler36">Cuyler36</a>, with me being credited for the documentation, even though this Editor was my idea.
